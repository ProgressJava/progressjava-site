# About Progress Java

**Progress Java** is an open-source learning project by [Suren Konathala](https://surenk.com), built with one simple purpose - to help developers **keep up with Java's rapid evolution** without getting buried under endless documentation.

---

## ⚙️ Why This Exists

Java has entered an era of **fast evolution**, with **a new major release every six months** led by the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org) and Oracle communities.  
While this pace keeps the language modern and powerful, it also makes it **hard for developers to stay current**.

Each new JDK brings new features, syntax improvements, and ecosystem updates and catching up means digging through hundreds of pages of release notes, JEPs, and blog posts. Most developers simply don't have that time.

**Progress Java** was created to **simplify learning** to break down what matters, why it matters, and how to use it in real projects.

## 🎯 Mission

To make Java learning:
- **Simpler** concise explanations that get straight to the point  
- **Fresher** updated every 6 months with the latest JDK release  
- **Practical** examples you can run, tweak, and build on  
- **Accessible** friendly to beginners yet valuable for professionals  

---

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

- **Core Java concepts**, reimagined with real examples  
- **Feature-by-feature breakdowns** of each JDK release  
- Hands-on code snippets for **Helidon, Jakarta EE, and Spring Boot**  
- **Mini challenges and try-it sections** to reinforce learning  
- Occasional **deep dives** for those who want to explore more  

Every topic answers three key questions:
1. What changed?  
2. Why does it matter?  
3. How can I use it today?

## 🚀 Origin Story

Suren built **Progress Java** after seeing how hard it was for even experienced engineers to stay aligned with the pace of change.  
As a Java veteran, educator, and community mentor, he wanted a **single, evolving site** that acts as a **living guide** — easy to read, regularly updated, and built by developers who love Java.
