# Java Fundamentals

Welcome to the Java Fundamentals section! Here you'll learn the essential concepts that form the foundation of Java programming.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

- **Basic Syntax**: Variables, data types, and control structures
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism
- **Collections**: Lists, sets, maps, and how to use them effectively
- **Exception Handling**: How to handle errors gracefully
- **Generics**: Type-safe collections and methods
- **Streams**: Functional programming with collections

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### Getting Started
- Setting up your development environment
- Writing your first Java program
- Understanding the Java ecosystem

### Core Concepts
- Variables and data types
- Operators and expressions
- Control flow (if/else, loops, switch)
- Methods and parameters

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and objects
- Constructors and methods
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Interfaces and abstract classes
- Encapsulation and access modifiers

### Advanced Topics
- Exception handling
- Generics and type safety
- Collections framework
- Stream API and functional programming
- File I/O and serialization

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Start with Basics**: Begin with variables and control structures
2. **Learn OOP**: Master object-oriented concepts
3. **Practice Collections**: Work with lists, sets, and maps
4. **Handle Errors**: Learn proper exception handling
5. **Explore Generics**: Understand type safety

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success
